export const defaultText = `Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump,
bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind
Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only
way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that
there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping
for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that
perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom,
and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are
going to say, 'But I thought he was a boy?'
'So did I,' said Christopher Robin.
'Then you can't call him Winnie?'
'I don't.'
'But you said'
'He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what “ther”
means?'
'Ah, yes, now I do,' I said quickly; and I hope you do
too, because it is all the explanation you are going to get.
Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some
sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes
to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story.
This evening
'What about a story?' said Christopher Robin.
'What about a story?' I said.
'Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?'
'I suppose I could,' I said. 'What sort of stories does
he like?'
'About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear.'
'Oh, I see.'
'So could you very sweetly?'
'I'll try,' I said. So I tried.
Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last
Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself
under the name of Sanders.
('What does “under the name” mean?' asked Christopher
Robin.
'It means he had the name over the door in gold letters
and lived under it.'
'Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,' said Christopher
Robin.
'Now I am,' said a growly voice.
'Then I will go on,' said I.)
One day when he was out walking, he came to an
open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle
of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of
the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.
Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put
his head between his paws, and began to think.
First of all he said to himself: That buzzing-noise
means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like
that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning
something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's
making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making
a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee.
Then he thought another long time, and said: 'And
the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making
honey.'
And then he got up, and said: 'And the only reason for
making honey is so as I can eat it.' So he began to climb
the tree.
He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as
he climbed he sang a little song to himself.`;
